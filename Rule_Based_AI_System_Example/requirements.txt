Symptom-to-Diagnosis Chatbot (Rule-Based AI System)
========================================

PROJECT OVERVIEW:
-----------------
This is a simple rule-based AI system that analyzes user-described symptoms 
and provides basic health condition assessments with advice. The system uses 
IF-ELIF-ELSE conditional logic and keyword matching to identify symptom patterns.

IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER:
This is NOT medical advice and NOT a real diagnostic tool. 
It is for educational purposes only to demonstrate rule-based AI systems.


SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:
--------------------
- Python 3.x (Python 3.6 or higher recommended)
- No external libraries required (uses only Python standard library)
- Operating System: Windows, macOS, Linux, or WSL


HOW TO RUN THE PROGRAM:
-----------------------

Option 1: Windows PowerShell / Command Prompt
   python symptom_chatbot.py

Option 2: Linux / macOS / WSL
   python3 symptom_chatbot.py

Option 3: Using Python directly
   1. Open a terminal/command prompt
   2. Navigate to the project directory
   3. Run: python symptom_chatbot.py (or python3 symptom_chatbot.py)


PROGRAM USAGE:
--------------
1. The program will display a welcome message and disclaimer
2. You will be prompted to describe your symptoms
3. Enter a description of your symptoms in natural language
   Example: "I have a runny nose, sore throat, and cough"
4. The program will analyze your input and provide:
   - A possible condition assessment
   - Relevant advice
5. You can continue entering different symptoms
6. Type 'quit' or 'exit' to end the program


SAMPLE INPUTS TO TRY:
---------------------
- "I have a runny nose, sore throat, and cough"
- "chest pain and shortness of breath"
- "sneezing and itchy watery eyes"
- "fever, cough, and body aches"
- "headache with light sensitivity and nausea"
- "feeling tired and exhausted"


RULE-BASED LOGIC:
-----------------
The system uses 7 main rules to assess symptoms:

1. Emergency Symptoms Rule - Detects serious symptoms requiring immediate medical attention
2. Flu-like Illness Rule - Identifies combination of fever, cough, and body aches
3. Common Cold Rule - Recognizes congestion, sore throat, and cough without high fever
4. Allergy Rule - Detects sneezing and itchy eyes without fever
5. Migraine Rule - Identifies headache with sensitivity to light/sound or nausea
6. General Fatigue Rule - Recognizes tiredness and mild illness symptoms
7. Unknown Condition Rule - Default response when symptoms don't match patterns


TECHNICAL DETAILS:
------------------
- Programming Language: Python 3
- AI Approach: Rule-Based System (No Machine Learning)
- Input Processing: Keyword matching on lowercase text
- Logic Structure: Conditional statements (if-elif-else)
- No external dependencies or API calls required


FILE STRUCTURE:
---------------
symptom_chatbot.py - Main program file containing all logic
README.md - Project documentation and reflection
LICENSE - Project license information
requirements.txt - This file (setup and usage instructions)


TROUBLESHOOTING:
----------------
Issue: "Python was not found"
Solution: Install Python 3.x from python.org or use 'python3' command

Issue: Program exits immediately
Solution: Ensure you're running from command line/terminal, not double-clicking

Issue: Symptoms not recognized
Solution: The system has limited keyword matching. Try using exact phrases 
         like "runny nose", "sore throat", "chest pain", etc.


EDUCATIONAL PURPOSE:
--------------------
This project demonstrates:
- Rule-based AI system design
- Conditional logic and decision trees
- Natural language keyword matching
- User input processing and validation
- Ethical considerations in health-related AI applications
